# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added

- Local embeddings now ship default-on with `nomic` and optional `multilingual-e5`.
- `recall embeddings setup` and `recall embeddings info` for model cache management.
- Provider comparison in retrieval evals via `recall eval retrieval --provider ...`.
- macOS Recall.app now surfaces background setup progress while launchd and the daemon rebuild the local store.

### Changed

- Recall now performs a destructive local DB reset on first boot after the embeddings cutover and rebuilds memory from repo scans.

### Upgrade Note

- First launch after upgrading resets Recall's local memory store.
- Existing local memories are cleared, repos are rescanned, and local embeddings/indexes are rebuilt in the background.
- The macOS app and daemon logs surface setup progress during that one-time migration.
